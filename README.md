## My process

I started by looking at the design and seeing how many HTML tags I'd need. When my HTML structure looked right, I started with the CSS. First thing I did was the image, then below that the background in white. I finished with the title and paragraph. I tried to fine-tune the whole thing to resemble the given design as closely as possible.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

At the time of publishing the project on GitHub, I already had some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. But the exercise allowed me to pick up where I left off.

### Continued development

As I learn HTML and CSS, if I can reduce or optimize this code, I'll change it.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) This has helped me discover additional information about CSS.
